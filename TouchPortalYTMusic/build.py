In order for buildScript to work, you need to have the following variables in your build file:
    - PLUGIN_ROOT: (Required)
        This lets the build script to know your plugin's root directory.
    - OUTPUT_PATH: (Required)
        This tells tppbuild where you want finished build tpp to be saved at. Default "./" meaning current dir where tppbuild is running from.
    - PLUGIN_MAIN: (Required)
        This lets tppbuild know where your main python plugin file is located so it will know which file to compile.
    - PLUGIN_EXE_NAME: (Required)
        This is the name of the executable file that is compiled by Pyinstaller.
    - PLUGIN_EXE_ICON: (Optional)
        This should be a path to a .ico file. However if png passed in, it will automatically converted to ico.
        Otherwise, it will use pyinstaller's default icon.
    - PLUGIN_ENTRY: (Required)
        This can be either path to entry.tp or path to a python file that contains infomation about entry.
        Note if you pass in a entry.tp, tppbuild will automatically validate the json. If you pass in a python file, it will
        build entry.tp & validate it for you. If validation fails, tppbuild will exit.
    - PLUGIN_ENTRY_INDENT: (Required)
        Indent level (spaces) for generated JSON. Use 0 for only newlines, or -1 for the most compact representation. Default is 2 spaces.
    - PLUGIN_VERSION: (Required)
        A version string will be used as part of .tpp file.
    - ADDITIONAL_FILES: (Optional)
        If your plugin requires any additional files for your plugin to work, you can add them here.
    - ADDITIONAL_PYINSTALLER_ARGS: (Optional)
        If you have additional arguments for Pyinstaller, you can add them here. otherwise default it will use these arguments:
        '--onefile', '--noconsole', '--distpath', 'dist', 'name', 'icon'
Even if you don't use all of the above variables, you still need to have the following variables in your build file
